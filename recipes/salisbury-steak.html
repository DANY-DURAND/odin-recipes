       <h1>Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms</h1>
       <img src="../assets/images/salisbury-steak.jpg" alt=" Delicious salisbury steak">
       <h3>Description</h3>
       <p>A great from-scratch salisbury steak and gravy recipe I found a long time ago. The mushroom and onion gravy is wonderful over mashed potatoes or rice. The gravy is still good without mushrooms.</p>
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes more. Transfer patties to a platter and keep warm.</li>
        <li>onion mixture to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water in a small bowl; stir into onion mixture. Cook and stir until onion gravy is thickened, about 1 minute. Pour over patties to serve.</li>
       </ol>
