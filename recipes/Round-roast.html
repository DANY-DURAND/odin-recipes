      <p>Tasty, tender eye of round roast. Expand your culinary arsenal with this hearty, paleo-friendly meal.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) beef eye of round roast</li>
        <li>aluminum foil</li>
        <li>½ cup dry red wine (merlot or cabernet sauvignon)</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix garlic, oil, salt, pepper, and thyme into a paste; rub all over beef roast. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Forty minutes into the hour, preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place two sheets of aluminum foil large enough to cover the beef roast on a baking sheet. Place beef roast on the foil sheets and transfer everything to the oven. Roast in the preheated oven for 18 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven; fold up the foil so it wraps the roast then return it to the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 170 degrees F (75 degrees C) and roast for one hour. After an hour, check the internal temperature with an instant-read thermometer: 120-125 degrees F will yield a rare center, 130-140 degrees F will yield a medium-rare center, and 140-150 degrees F will yield a medium center.</li>
        <li>Remove roast and set it on a cutting board to rest. Transfer any drippings from roast into a saucepan; stir in red wine and beef broth and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat until reduced by 1/4. Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in cubes of butter, one at a time, until incorporated into sauce. Add salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the roast into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with pan sauce poured on top.</li>
      </ol>
